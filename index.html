<h1>Gundam</h1>
  <h2>What is Gundam?</h2>
	<p>Gundam is an amazing anime series that started in 1979. Gundam has, therefore, been around for a considerable amount of time (over 30 years).
Gundam has had many variations, timelines, and series. With the debut of Mobile Suit Gundam in 1979, Amuro Ray, with his RX-78, and his rival Char
Aznable come on the scene. After this came many heroes such as, Kamille Bidan and his Zeta Gundam, Domon Kasshu and his Shining/Burning
Gundams, Heero Yuy and his Wing Zero Gundam, plus many others. There are also video games based on the Gundam Universes ranging from old arcade games
to the Xbox 360. I, myself, have only played the first two games on Xbox 360, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam and Gundam 2.</p>
	<p>So far, I have completed the first DW: Gundam game and I am pretty far into the second. Therefore, I must now tell you my favorite Gundams to 
use. Here is a list of my favorite Gundams and thier original pilots. Keep in mind, though, that I have not played through Gundam 2 nor have I played Gundam 3, so I have not 
played as all possible Mobile Suits or Gundams.</p>

	<li>RX-78 Gundam. Amuro Ray.</li>
	<li>Nu Gundam. Amuro Ray.</li>
	<li>Sazabi. Char Aznable.</li>
